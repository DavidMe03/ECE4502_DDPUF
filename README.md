# ECE4502_DDPUF
Repository that will contain information regarding the final project for ECE 4502 at UVA. This project will focus on DD-PUF generation on FPGAs. 

## Objective and Motivation

## Introduction/Context of Project

## Implementation Details
1. DD-PUF generator block implementation
2. FSM Design
The FSM block should have two outputs: start and reset. These outputs control the duration of the generate signal, or how long a logic high is set to the input of the DD-PUF generator.
Additionally, the FSM block has a single input taken from the SPI block: duration. 
4. SPI Interface
The SPI block has 4 connections that expose the SPI interface: MOSI, MISO, CS, and SCK. The block is connected to the SPI interface of the PS (?). The PS sends commands to the MISO pin of the SPI block.
The SPI block also has an output that sets the duration of the generate signal.
Finally, the SPI block takes in the 128-bit response generated by the DD-PUF and outputs it through the MISO pin. 


## Actions that neeed to be completed:
1. DD-PUF bit cell design
  a. Create verilog block
  b. Connect to PS
  c. Do manual routing and test
2. 128-bit DD-PUF generator block design
  a. Connect 128 bit cells into a block
3. FSM design
  a. Create Verilog Block
4. SPI interface design
  a. Use Xilinx IP block for SPI interface
